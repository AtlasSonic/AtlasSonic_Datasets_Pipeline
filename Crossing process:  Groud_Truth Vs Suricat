- The Crossing process consists of validating the Ground truth labels using Suricata rules. To do so, we folloed these steps:
    1. Analaysing each Datasets pcap files with Suricata
    2. Converting  Suricata Json file to CSV format for each Dataset using evejson2csv.py 
    3. Filtering the resulting csv file to extract statistics on Suricata analysis (results distribution: Alerted/Not Alerted)
    4. Comparing the results with the Ground Truth Statistics (NFstream annotatio)
    5. For each 5-Tuple, within the GT communicated time range, we verify if it is labaled as Alerted with Suricata and compare the resulted flows with GT labels
    6. We Create a new Datasets with the the flows that have been
